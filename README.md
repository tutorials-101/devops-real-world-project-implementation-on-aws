- **Text Editor:** Any code editor (VS Code recommended) for editing configuration files.
- **Internet Connection:** Stable connection for AWS console access and downloading tools.

### **Helpful (But Not Mandatory):**
- **Basic Programming:** Understanding of basic programming concepts helps with microservices code, but not required.
- **AWS Basics:** Familiarity with core AWS concepts (EC2, VPC, IAM) is helpful but we cover what's needed.
- **Version Control:** Basic Git knowledge beneficial for CI/CD section.
- **Networking Fundamentals:** Understanding of IP addresses, subnets, and ports enhances learning.

### **What You DON'T Need:**

- AWS CLI
- Terraform
- kubectl
- Helm
- Docker (on EC2, not locally)
- Various VS Code extensions

### **Cost Expectations:**
- Some AWS services used are not in free tier
- We optimize for cost throughout and provide cleanup instructions
- **Estimated cost:** $20-$50 if you complete entire course and clean up resources after each section
